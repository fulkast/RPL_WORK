This A-star implementation finds a feasible path where possible between a start and end node.
It requires an occupancy grid which shows the obstacle presence on the map. 

NOTE! The parameters are passed through execution parameters which call the parameters file: "Parameters.txt"

== Description ==

This implementation utilizes a heap priority queue to store the set of open nodes to be visited by the algorithm. Parents of nodes are stored in a hash table which maps between spatial nodes and spatial nodes. A pseudo code of the algorithm may be found at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm


== Usage ==

The variables for a particular task may be input at through a text file put in the directory:
"/roboscoop/thymio_app/". The user then has to include the name of this file as an execution parameter. 

It has been shown that the code performs significantly better when compiled through the finalize command in EiffelStudio.
